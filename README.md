# Sonic.exe 2.5/3.0
This branch/repo is me gonna try and finish the source code and everything & fix compatibility with MacOS & such.

Thank's Duskie for releasing source code. (I wanna give you sloppy kisses on the lips <3)

No, it's not dead.

This uses the haxelib version of hxCodec `haxelib install hxCodec`

**THE GIT VERSION OF HXCODEC WILL NOT WORK. MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THE HAXELIB VERSION BEFORE YOU MAKE AN ISSUE**

Special Thanks:

[PolybiusProxy](https://github.com/polybiusproxy) - Made hxCodec.
